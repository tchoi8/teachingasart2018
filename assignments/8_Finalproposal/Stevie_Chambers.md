# Final Proposal

## TWEET IRL

**Inspired by:**

## Description:
The **TWEET IRL** workshop (or session) is an in-person mix and mingle, with an interactive component that relates directly to the atmosphere of the Twitter app. In this space, participants have hand held signs to use to share when they simply want to restate (or “retweet”) and /or “like” someone else’s statement. This mixer is meant to be verbal for the most part - the signs are a visual correspondence that moderate-avid twitter users will recognize instantly. I hope to be able to set about 15 minutes aside at the end of this workshop to discuss how much different the experience was for each person - Tweeting IRL rather than virtually. The twitter experience varies, depending on individual level of involvement, number of and demographic of followers/followed tweeps (twitter peeps), personal interests, and other considerations as well.

## What I’ll need:
* A handful of moderate-avid twitter users
* Retweet/Like signs for each user/participant
