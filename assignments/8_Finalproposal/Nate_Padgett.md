# Learn how to make games with Scratch! 

[Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) is a free tool developed by the [Lifelong Kindergarten](https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/lifelong-kindergarten/overview/) group at MIT Media Lab for learning creative programing. Built to be accessible to beginners of all ages, Scratch utilizes a block-based programming system that lets budding creative technologists literally snap together bits of code for programming games, digital art, and music.

During this 1.5 hour workshop we will explore building digital games using Scratch. Participants will learn how to create their own game elements and how to code their game using Scratch blocks. We will conclude the class with a discussion about Scratch profiles and Scratch’s global online community of creative coders. By the end of the workshop, participants will have their own functional Scratch game and the konwledge and confidence to start contributing to the Scratch community on their own.

**Students:** ages 8 and up. Students under the age of 16 must be accompanied by an adult.

**Audience size:** 10-20 people in groups of two

**Duration:** 1.5 hours

**Materials:** A laptop that can connect to Wifi.

**Where:** TBD (Considering Collab in Tribeca, ITP, or Brooklyn Research)


### Schedule: 

#### Welcome and introduction to the class (5 min)


#### Icebreaker and meeting one another (10 min)
Participants introduce themselves. Share their first name, experience with Scratch, and what brought them to the class. 


#### Introducing Scratch (10 min)
Participants will have created a Scratch account prior to coming to class. During this part of the class, the facilitator will instruct participants to login into their accounts and will demonstrate: 
* Creating projects a new project. 
* Snapping blocks together
* How to make a character or objects on the screen move and make sound
* How to create and add more characters or objects
* Creating your own blocks


#### Creating a Project (30 min)
Working in pairs, participants design a their own games and build them in Scratch. The games don’t have to be story based, but participants are highly encouraged to create narrative games. After 25 minutes students will be asked to save their work and prepare to present their game to the class. 


#### Project Feedback (20 min)
One person from each team will move to the team on their left to provide feedback on their neighbors game. The remaining teammate will stay with his or her projects to explain it to their new critic. Presenters will quickly introduce their game and how to play it, and critics will play and give feedback. Critics will rotate to a new game every 2-4 minutes, depending on the number of teams. 


#### Next Steps (10 min)
The facilitator will demonstrate how to view projects created by other Scratch users and how to make remixes. Participants will be introduced to the Scratch community and the concept of open source technology. The workshop will conclude with a list of resources for continued exploration of Scratch and free resources for diving deeper into creative computing. 


#### Final 5 minutes
The remaining 5 minutes can be used for answering classes or as a buffer if extra time is needed. Participants can reach the facilitator outside of class if there isn’t time to get to questions.
