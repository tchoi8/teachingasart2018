## building a quiet guest house

(More at [kathy's blog](https://pondermake.tumblr.com/post/172726669524/building-a-quiet-guest-house).)

Last fall, I was a part of the first two sessions of [Quiet Girl Collective.](https://www.facebook.com/quietgirlcollective/) They are a new NYU student group which gathers women of color who identify as introverted or shy, and aims to create a loving, healing, conversational space.

The women I’ve met through this community strike me as thoughtful, compassionate, observant. I felt really joyful to find this space, and resonant with many folks I met there.

For my workshop, I’d like to collaborate with the Quiet Girl Collective. With this session, I want to focus on art-making, healing, and the body.

I'd like to ask the questions:
* where does emotion sit with you, in the body?
* checking in: where does it feel easy? where does it feel hard?
* how can art-making with hands help let go of burden?

____________

### Lecture/intro: 15 minutes
* Introduce myself. For me growing up, art, poetry, sculpture was a way to be OK with my quiet self. It was healing in times of difficulty.
* Show a few slides showing: andy goldsworthy, karen kuo's dorodangos (meditative mud balls), christina bertoni. You can make a lot of things simply, and for free.

### Activity: 35 minutes. Inviting an emotion over for dinner.

* Short mediation. Close your eyes, notice your breathing, your feeling. Notice any emotions right now. Where do you feel them? Can you imagine yourself on an elevator, stopping at each floor in the body, opening the doors, looking out? 

* With eyes still closed, I’ll read this poem for you: [The Houseguest](https://allpoetry.com/poem/8534703-The-Guest-House-by-Mewlana-Jalaluddin-Rumi), by Rumi.

* Build a guest house for your emotion, a small one you can keep on your desk at home. It can be a house-shaped house, it can be a boat, it can be a vase.
What does your guest house look like? Wood, cardboard, sticks, paper.

* In your home, invite your emotions to come and stay. See if you can be a witness. Write it down if you'd like. Who is staying there right now? What will you serve them for dinner?

* I’ll pass out some flowers for you to keep inside.

### Wrap up: 10 minutes.
* You can talk about it, you can write about it. Whatever is most comfortable.

With this workshop, I hope a participant walks away with a new tool to consider, and a new respect for their hands and body without necessarily needing the expertise of “Artistness.”
