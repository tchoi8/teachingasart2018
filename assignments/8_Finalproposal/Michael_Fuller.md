Art, Material & Touch

Pedagogy
The Artist connects to their Art through touch. Whether the painter through the paintbrush and paint on to the canvas, or the Sculptureâ€™s malleability in forming the composition, the material is the conduit for that expression. Michelangelo was said to want to chip away the marble to expose the figure within and Alberto Giacometti manipulated the clay to unshackle the figure from its prison. The material and the Artists understanding of it helps to conceive and the realization of the Art.

To explore this idea, I want to create a workshop to better understand material by touch without sight.  I think there is insight into understanding a material through touch, feeling it, forming it, composing it and playing with it to change or compose the material in some way to express an idea. The better understanding of the material or medium can give the Artist a deeper relationship to the Art they want to express.

Curriculum 
The workshop will center around touching feeling and exploring a material and getting an understanding of it. Then manipulating it to feel its inherent properties and possible advantages and limitations.
A few different materials are set out for the participant to choose and explore.
The participants are blindfolded and then touch explore and manipulated the material to understand it.
Using your imagination through touch, form and compose the material.
Remove the blindfold, see and discuss the exploration of the material and how it is formed and rendered by touch
Explore the idea of material as art 
Can the material as the medium for expression be understood by touch without seeing it.
