**Shapes of narratives with plastics**

The workshop will be presented in a participatory environment that revolves around the intersection of creative storytelling, design and art. The workshop proposes to have a group experience as a vehicle for communication that aims to foster our evolving relationships with our very own narrative, handcraft and materials through creative play. The two hours workshop will be held in ITP over the weekend with participants of not more than 20, with group age of 18 and above. The participants will have an opportunity to explore the correlation between shapes and narratives, blurring the lines using plastics as the main element of choice. 

The workshop will be separated into two parts. To allow the participants to be in a sphere of thinking and sphere of making, they will engage the workshop by experimenting with cut out paper shapes and form simple narratives with them. To relay their personal narrative or a statement they wish to express, participants will manipulate plastic as a medium by creating shapes on their own and bond them together using heat setting. The workshop seeks participants to stretch the dynamics of their presented narratives or statement and the material they used while pushing their creativity and embrace possibilities. Towards the end of the workshop, participants are encourage to create a usable object, i.e.: a bag, lamp etc. from the bonded plastics they made. The workshop doesn't require any arts background but a little imagination and an open mind.
