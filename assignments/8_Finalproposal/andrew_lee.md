# Kmeans Clustering

## Workshop Goals

My goal for the workshop is a soft landing into the world of machine learning with a brief intro to linear algebra.

I've picked k-means clustering as a first algorithm since 

- requires just high school level math
- easily visualized
- explainable without any black boxes
- flexible with data inputs

Ideally, participants will leave the workshop with confidence that they can figure out how machine learning works.

## Intended Audience

I'm imagining this workshop as one of the final modules in a 2 credit class taught at ITP about data analysis. So, my primary audience is for ITP students interested in working with data, making data viz and art.

I also think this could be useful for social science and business programs. Most syllabi I've found for data analysis in such programs are overly focused on stastical modelling and data science, not designing and answering questions.

## Workshop outline

### Algebra

- no new math, just new dimensions
- whiteboard linear algebra operations
- code examples of linear algebra operations

### Machine Learning

- what does it mean for the machine to learn?
- supervised vs unsupervised

### Kmeans Clustering

- whiteboard walkthrough
- discuss limitations
- code walkthrough and discuss results
