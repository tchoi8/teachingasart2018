# Mechanism Design and Power Transmission for Women in the Workplace

## Workshop Goals

Every time I read/hear one of those stories about women's experiences at work, I'm like yeah girl, I know. There are many things that we deal with and things that we should do but feel uncomfortable doing.

My goal is to teach students practical knowledge about mechanisms that they could implement in their projects, and provide a space and time to rethink the way we view ourselves in relation to our work environment. Tech is traditionally a male dominated field, and I believe combining confidence and technical knowledge is powerful. Looking back on my experience, the system sucks, but we need to ask for more.

## Workshop Summary

**Part 1**

Introduce myself and the workshop. I will also give an overview of the schedule.

We will have a discussion on key issues women face in the workplace. [Here is a source of great info](https://hbr.org/2018/01/podcast-women-at-work) among others I will draw from.

A small presentation on basic elements of mechanical components and examples. The main take away is that mechanisms take an input force and movement and convert that to an output force and movement.

**Part 2**

A series of cards with different mechanical components will be handed to everyone. It'll be color coded to let users connect them to create paper versions of their eventual mechanisms. There will be an explanation of what it does on the back. We'll go around each person will *confidently* tell us about it. Rules: You can't say sorry or give us a disclaimer.

**Part 3**

Put together a mechanism based on goals (ex - convert rotational movement in this direction to translational movement in that direction). I'll have extra cards with components to people to grab from.

**Conclusion**

Final thoughts & ask for feedback.
