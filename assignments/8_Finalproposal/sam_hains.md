## Webscraping and the Generative Internet

This workshop introduces the notion of the internet as a revolutionary generative art tool. It will also function as an overview of various hacker tools and techniques for appropriating data from the internet.


When we think about generative design, often the first thing that comes to mind is geometric shapes and patterns - However as we labour over various bouncing ball experiments in Processing we should not fail to consider that the internet is in itself a gigantic, data-driven, generative system. I would like to encourage students to think more broadly about the possibilities of 'Generativity' in computational art amidst the pulsating data megatropolis that is internet culture.

In order to take advantage of the generative nature of the internet we benefit from beginning a learning journey into basic automation, data appropriation and hacker tools.

We must tread carefully when it comes to any form of appropriation - which is why I would like to spend some time grounding the workshop in critical notions of hacker culture and appropriation. I need to find some better resources for this but at the moment the concept of [Detourement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%A9tournement) seems relevant here and its notion of "Hijacking" cultural materials to counter or explicate an underlying ideology. [Hacker Manifesto](http://www.neme.org/texts/hacker-manifesto) - another relevant reference.

I imagine that the workshop will be split into 3 major sections:

**Introduction** (15 minutes) - Introduce internet as the master generator, examples of engagements with this idea.
**Critique** (15 minutes)- Introduce the idea of Detournment, and some other critical references. What does it mean to uses materials that are loaded with their own meaning and significance?
**Techniques** (30 minutes)- Introduction to python webscraping and command line tools for appropriating data

This workshop is designed for students of ITP who are presumed to have a basic understanding of programming and technical concepts. Given this specific target audience, I hope that on some level, the workshop would function as a critique of more classical notions of generative design taught in introductory classes. However, I imagine that it could be extended into a series of workshops for individuals with no prior experience.

This workshop also exists (in my head) as a first attempt to try and map out a broader vision for a more contemporary, data-driven 'Introduction to Computational Media' curriculum.
