## Generators of the Mind and Internet

This workshop examines the notion of the internet as a generative art tool
and the importance of self-aware, context aware practice.

When we think about generative design, often the first thing that comes to mind is geometric shapes and patterns - However as we labour over various bouncing ball experiments in Processing we should not fail to consider that the internet is in itself a gigantic, data-driven, generative system. I would like to encourage students to think more broadly about the possibilities of 'Generativity' in computational art amidst the pulsating data megatropolis that is internet culture.

The of the workshop will be split into the following sections:
1. Introduce the concept of generator in relation to artistic practice
2. Provide a historical overview of the use of artistic generators. Particularly:
    - surrealists and their use of the subconcious mind and dreams
    - beats and their 'cut ups'
3. Activity: go for a 'walk' through filesharing community, creating an audio collage
from voice memos
4. Google as a generator. Potentiality and dangers.
5. Examples and techniques for subversively navigating this space to ones advantage.
