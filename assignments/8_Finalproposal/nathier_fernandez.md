Blind butterflies and kaleidoscopic eyes

"or, How to draw like an insect"




Introduction
Some time ago there was a movement called “The age of reflection” which was an intellectual movement that
incorporated romanticism to science and humanities. and advocated for the increase of scientific knowledge 
and the importance of sharing any new discovery with the world. Alexander Von Humbolt dreamed with a 
community where artist and scientist could grow from each other, and it happened. Humbolt’s expeditions 
inspired writers and artist alike, he is sometimes considered the father of ecology, as being the first to 
saw relationships between organisms and their environment, but before Humbolt, there was a German naturalist 
and scientific illustrator who saw this connection long before Humbolt himself. Maria Sybilla Merian is 
considered one of the founders of ecology. Insects were her leitmotif, she looked and depicted the natural 
world as no one did before, she went on expeditions to South America and financed her publication long before 
it was fashionable. This workshop is dedicated to her.

“Merian documented, many years before the naturalists of the time, the life cycles of butterflies, moths, and 
other insects. Her work is exquisite from an aesthetic perspective, but what interests me more is that as a 
woman in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, she was able to make scientific contributions 
that would have been impossible in virtually any other field, simply by virtue of using the specimens from her 
own garden. She eventually traveled to Surinam to study the brilliantly colored insects of the steamy jungle, 
but that was after her interests had been firmly set. Although she, like many other women scientists and 
naturalists, faced opposition for her unfeminine activities, the accessibility of her subjects meant that she 
could keep doing the work she loved.”

Workshop 
//


This is a drawing workshop, inspired by insects. It requires no drawing skills.

Materials will be provided

10 People max

One hour


Blind butterflies and kaleidoscopic eyes, look at the drawing process as a communication medium, it explores 
the creative process through fast drawings, unexpected compositions and exploration of technique. Mistakes 
are embraced as part of the finals compositions of our own plates. A scientific illustration is one that 
communicates visually the structure and specific details of biological subjects, this workshop aims to 
develop skills of close observation and plastic explorations. All in Maria’s spirit.

There will be two main parts to the workshop. One will be focused on drawing through insect eyes, with 
exercises that challenge preconceived notions of drawing. The other will develop different techniques to 
illustrate insects, from exquisite core methods to create our very own specimens to my own Coleoptera [Beetles] 
fast ink approach.
