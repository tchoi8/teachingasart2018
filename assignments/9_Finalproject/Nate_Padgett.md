I recently taught an hour long workshop on Scratch to a small, intimate group of fellow ITP students and one person who found the workshop on Eventbrite. Further reflections on the workshop can be found [on my blog](http://www.natepadgett.com/2018/04/22/final-scratching-the-surface/). 

*Here is the full syllabus from the workshop:*

# Scratching The Surface
While it is certainly true that not everyone  needs to know how to code, it is undeniable that technical literacy and systems thinking are important skills in our technology-driven society. [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) is a free tool developed by the [Lifelong Kindergarten](https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/lifelong-kindergarten/overview/) group at the MIT Media Lab to teach computational and creative thinking to children. It utilizes a block-based programming language that lets budding young technologists literally snap together bits of code for programming games, digital art, and music. Through this approachable, visual style of coding, kids are exposed to computational thinking and the creative process.

During this 1 hour workshop we will learn how to use Scratch to build simple interactive experiences. By the end of the workshop, you will have a functional understanding of Scratch so you can teach your own kid-friendly coding workshops. We’ll conclude the class with a discussion about the Scratch online community and other block coding platforms. 

**Audience:** ITP students

**Duration:** 1 hours

**Materials:** A laptop that can connect to WiFi

**Where:** ITP, Classroom 15

# Schedule:

**Welcome and introduction to the class (5 min)**

Brief introduction to the class and syllabus. 

**Icebreaker and meeting one another (5 min)**

We’ll introduce ourselves and briefly talk about what brought everyone to the class and any teaching experience we have.

**Introducing Scratch (20 min)**

We’ll briefly discuss:

 * What is Scratch?

* What is a backdrop?

* What are sprites? 

* What are costumes? 

* What are blocks?

* Using blocks 

* Creating new blocks

**Creating a Project (20 min)**

Design your own experience in Scratch. It should use key presses, mouse presses, or your computer’s webcam to trigger events. Bonus points if you tell a story.

**Project Feedback (5 min)**

We’ll present our games to the group and describe our process and what blocks we used build it. 

**Next Steps (5 min)**

We’ll talk about sharing projects, project pages, and the Scratch community. We’ll talk about the Scratch Github, the limitations of Scratch, and other block-based coding platforms and resources.
