This week taught my workshop for *Teaching as Art*. The workshop was intended as a gentle introduction to machine learning.

## Content

We worked through three sections, each with a notebook of prose and code:

1. [What is a Vector?](https://beta.observablehq.com/@vndrewlee/linear-algebra-scratchpad)
2. [K-Means Walkthrough](https://beta.observablehq.com/@vndrewlee/kmeans-workshop)
3. [ML5 / Word2Vec Demo](https://beta.observablehq.com/@vndrewlee/bare-minimum-ml5-demo)

## Execution

The workshop was an hour long and ended right at 60 minutes.

We spend about half the time on linear algebra, 20 minutes on k-means, and the last 10 minutes on Word2Vec.

## Feedback

I collected feedback with a survey. The feedback was overall very positive. The critical feedback was:

- "You say 'like' a lot"
- "I do wish there was a little more interactive participation"

## Next Steps

- Working on finding opportunies to encourage more discussion and exercises
- Slowing down my speaking and planning my explanations ahead of time
