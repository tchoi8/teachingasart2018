Blind butterflies and kaleidoscopic eyes, or how to draw like an insect is a drawing workshop, inspired by insects and dedicated to the work of naturalist Maria Sibylla Merian. This workshop will explore the creative process of drawing through fast strokes, unexpected compositions and different techniques. Mistakes are embraced as part of the finals compositions of our own plates. A scientific illustration is one that communicates visually the structure and specific details of biological subjects, this workshop aims to develop skills of close observation and plastic exploration.


For this workshop, I joined forces with the team behind ITP’s  Drawing + Club leading one of their session (Wednesday 11th) with Blind Butterflies and Kaleidoscopic eyes. Their sessions usually go for two hours, so I took the opportunity and made my workshop a little longer than planned and try the two parts o the original workshop. Around 15 people participate, all of them ITP students. Some joined from the beginning, others after the break, some couldn’t stay for long or went to office hour and came back.
