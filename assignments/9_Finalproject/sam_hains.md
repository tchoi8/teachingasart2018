Workshop description is here:

"From Picasso's fascination with African artifacts, to the surrealists and the unconcious mind, to Cage and the I-Ching, to internet artists and their 'Google Sculptures' - artists have always used the 'unpredictable' or 'other' to generate ideas.

In the era of search engine collage and auto-complete poetry we have been gifted with a plethora of ways in which we can bring chaos and sponteneity into our work. After all, the internet is a gigantic, data-driven, generative system - brimming with creative potential and emergent madness.

In this workshop we will look at historical examples of generators, as well as the politics, dangers and methods of the current 'internet-as-generator' zeitgeist.

We will be exploring questions such as: How do we use the internet to generate ideas? How might we do this thoughtfully? For what purpose are these algorithms originally assembled?

Participants will leave with an expanded notion of the internet as an 'art generator' as well as ways in which they may bring its generative potential into their work."
