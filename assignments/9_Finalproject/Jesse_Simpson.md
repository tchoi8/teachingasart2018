Syllabus

Sound synthesis is an ever-evolving area of study and this workshop aims to look back at vintage technology (analog/modular synthesis) as a means for better understanding the same principles applied in computer music.  

Learning Objectives

To develop a base for understanding the behavior of sound and the different components for manipulating it.

Learning Outcomes

Students will learn the basics of sound design through the study and use of the fundamental components of a synthesizer.  A basic history of modular synthesizers will also be discussed. 

Discussion

*Components of a synthesizer*
* Basic synth voice
  * VCO - Voltage Controlled Oscillator
  * Waveforms - Sine, Square, Triangle, Sawtooth, Noise
  * 1 V/OCT
  * VCF - Voltage Controlled Filter
  * VCA - Voltage Controlled Amplifier
  * LFO - Low-Frequency Oscillator
  * ADSR Envelope - Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release
  * Mixer

*Interactive Demonstration*

* Building a basic synth voice as a group
* Patch techniques
* Making a ‘song’ - introduction of new modules
* Sequencers
