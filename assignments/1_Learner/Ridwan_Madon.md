As a learner, before pursuing on with the topic that I am about to learn. I like to research on my own and give myself a broad overview of the topic. Many may find this a terrible idea because I am placing myself in a compromising situation where I could get intimidated and give up before I even start. However, contrary to what many believe, this process gives me a brief understanding of the topic that I am going to learn, allowing me to preempt myself for any difficult task that I may fall into. I have been in a situation where I had to juggle between understanding or trying to understand very well about the topic that I am learning. If the topic is too difficult, I rarely place my hands down and give up totally. However, I have had an experience where the subject was too complex to grasp and I resorted to two avenues where I feel I could understand it better. The way I approached this is simple, I will look for online resources, websites or books that talk about the topic with a concise view. I do not normally read the whole book in its entirety, not yet at least, but enough to give me basic understanding of the theory and a better insight on the topic. More often than not, I will make small mind-maps for me to better digest the information.

However, if the subject is heavier on the practical side, I will refer to online tutorials like lynda.com or even Youtube. Most of the time while learning, I would write notes that I find important and archive them on my google drive, separating them on different folders for specific topics or week. I do also find it is easier to work with peers who are taking the same subject as me. Two heads are definitely better than one, having a discussion among each other and making sure that I am on track is paramount to progress further.

Taking a break in between my learning process is vital. I always believe a healthy mind is not loaded with too much information and taking intermittent breaks is very beneficial. The whole process will repeat itself after implementing all of the processes that I have started from the beginning. This method of learning has been proven effective for me since I was in college and I have been using it since. I donâ€™t believe there is one solution or method for everyone to use, it really depends on the person and how best he can learn.
