## reflections on 10th grade
I’m thinking back and trying to remember who I was as a 10th grader. Anxious, shy, thoughtful. Like other 10th graders, still learning how I relate to the whole. 

The classes I remembered most had a real emotional impact on me, whether it was that I felt cared for by my professor and classmates, or fairly isolated. As a general rule, emotional experience seems to have far more longevity than any intellectual one.

For me, high school emphasized the individual’s performance over the collective. There was an anxious energy of comparing, being evaluated… and for many, that evaluation becomes their identity. (“I’m not a math person…”)

## towards collective success

I wonder what it would take for the majority of people to feel intrinsically motivated to lift each other up. 

Once in college, I took a neuroscience class, where our professor designed a midterm exam so that everybody got a single, collective grade.

In that one hour, the class dynamic was amazing; everybody became a teacher and a student; there was a collective sense of responsibility towards one another, where people pulled each other up, and didn’t want to let one another down.

Another time I can think of: this past summer, volunteering in rural Cambodia, where everyday, the volunteers would clean the common space, cook food for each other, wash the dishes. We lived with farm animals, collected rainwater to survive. I felt a real sense of accountability to the people around me; there was mutual care and struggle.

## learning outcomes:

Students understand that they exist as part of a broader whole.
* students observe how your species relates to its various biomes
* students discuss how their cultural identity relates to history

Students value collective success. They depend on each other.
* work which invites people to work together & teach each other
* credit is given, but for how much you contribute to others

Students learn that everything is made by people.
* understand that all tools & media can be used to imbue values
* what values do you want to embed?

Students develop habits which respect to their whole being.
* students are invited to listen to their body, through yoga, walking, games
* students develop emotional literacy through listening and sharing


## learning objectives (days in the new 10th grade)

A day which starts with taking care of your communal space, whether it’s tending to things that live, cleaning, or sharing food with each other.

A day which lets you walk through your surroundings together. Learn who lived in this city before you, the families that live here now;  draw a map about it.

There is a class on body, energy, and planet, which combines physical education, biology, chemistry, earth science, studies of energy & physics.

There is a class on media and tech literacy; students read books of diverse authors, examine Facebook and new media sources with rigor, write about gender, race, and human-made constructs.

There is a class on teaching; ways to mentor and lift younger students up in a group without overpowering others.

There is a class on art and computation, where you learn to draw, make films, and use current tools in a structured environment.

## an idealistic spirit, grounded in making

At times, students feel as if they are colonizing a new planet together. It looks just like Earth, but without humans. What do you want to keep? What do you leave behind?
