I’m thinking back and trying to remember who I was as a 10th grader. At that age, you’re not quite an adult; you’re still trying on new environments. A lot of the most impactful stuff is about your identity in relation to the whole.

## on being part of a whole
Once in college, I took a neuroscience class, where our professor designed a midterm exam so that everybody got a single, collective grade.

In that one hour, the class dynamic was amazing; everybody became a teacher and a student; there was a collective sense of responsibility towards one another, where people pulled each other up, and didn’t want to let one another down. 


## on “well-roundedness,” & power of knowing
Schools want you to be well-rounded, because some broader institutional standard wants you to be. But “well-rounded” could mean a variety of things. Why certain subjects?

For instance, subjects in science challenge your trust in knowledge. How do you know anything is true, which you cannot directly perceive?

What can knowing these things accomplish? What power do they give you?
I think this is the ultimate discovery.

## days in the new 10th grade curriculum

A day which starts with taking care of your communal space, whether it’s tending to things that live, cleaning, or sharing food with each other.

A day which lets you walk through your surroundings together. Learn who lived in this city before you; perhaps draw a map about it.

A day where you and your peers build something helpful out of something that is free just to give it away.

A day where you and your peers make your own museum, textbook, guided tour; tell me why you think art, music, science is defined as it is.

A day where you are colonizing a new planet together. It looks just like Earth, but without humans. What do you want to keep? What do you leave behind?


## philosophies

These are all things I learnt better outside of high school. Here is what I wish for:

A curriculum where you are part of a broader whole.
* where you observe how your species relates to its various biomes
* where you think about the measurable effects that your actions have on people around you

A curriculum where people depend on each other.
* which invites people to work together & teach each other
* credit is given, but for how much you contribute to others

A curriculum where you learn that everything is made by people.
* you learn that all tools & media can be used to imbue values
* what values do you want to embed?

A curriculum which shows respect to your whole being.
* which invites you to listen to your body
* which invites emotional literacy; listening and sharing
* which responds to “failure” with a chance to reflect, and try again.
