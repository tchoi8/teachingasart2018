## **Introduction: (5mins)** ##

***What is the workshop about?***
The workshop will be presented in a participatory environment that revolves around the intersection of creative storytelling, design and art. The workshop proposes to have a group experience as a vehicle for communication that aims to foster our evolving relationships with our very own narrative, handcraft and materials through creative play. The one hour workshop will be held in ITP over the weekend with participants of not more than 10, with group age of 18 and above. The participants will have an opportunity to explore the correlation between shapes and narratives, blurring the lines using plastics as the main element of choice.

The workshop will be separated into two parts. To allow the participants to be in a sphere of thinking and sphere of making, they will engage the workshop by experimenting with cut out paper shapes and form simple narratives with them. To relay their personal narrative or a statement they wish to express, participants will manipulate plastic as a medium by creating shapes on their own and bond them together using heat setting. The workshop seeks participants to stretch the dynamics of their presented narratives or statement and the material they used while pushing their creativity and embrace possibilities. Towards the end of the workshop, participants are encourage to create a usable object, i.e.: a bag, lamp etc. from the bonded plastics they made. The workshop doesn't require any arts background but a little imagination and an open mind.

## **What will the participants learn? (5mins)** ##

Break the common boundaries of storytelling: What are common ways of storytelling? Books, photos, movies, common media. Today, we will explore uncommon way of storytelling , using plastics to narrate your story. 

* House Rules
  * Working with light heat & plastics
  * Participant can be observer if they are not comfortable working with them.
  * In case of fire: show Fire exits

* Items Required
  * Iron
  * Plastics, variety of colors
  * Paper
  
## **Collective Storytelling (5mins)** ##
 
How do we create narrative collectively? In this exercise, we will learn how to start a narrative by first sharing a random beginning of a story, the first participant who shared his/her story will then point out to another person and he/she would have to continue where the first person left. The process will continue until it reaches the last person.

## **Toying with Plastics + Narrative with Plastics (45 mins)** ##

*_Examples:_*
Show examples of work created with plastics to give participants a clearer view of works made with plastics. 

Toying with Plastics
Participants will be presented a summary of a short story, with the tools presented, participants are required to dissect the story into shapes or patterns using the plastics.  

Narrative with Plastics
Participants were given 4 themes to play with, Love, Home, Life or others. With the plastics provided, participants are asked to create a narrative based on their chosen theme.
